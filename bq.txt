最Challenge的project
ans: The most challenge task for me is that the load balancer's improvement project.
A brief backgound here: Our team is supporint XDB Backup/Restore features. For the restore, it creates a new db and restore data and replay transaction log on that brand new database. Our deployment team kicks off code deployment every month. During the deployment, we need to shut down the node and replace the binary files. However, if a custmer issued restore request on that node, we cannot perform the upgrade. And it will become a blocker. Sometimes, the deployment train may carry important hot patch to mitigate live site issue, the blocker can be vital. My task is improving the current LB to route the restore request to the node which has done the upgrade or the upgrade request will be engaged on this node days later. 
The code is simple ---- add a new metric into the load balancer, however, how large weight will you put on this new metric? what is priority of this metric. Other request like creating db or copy db also share this LB, will it impact other teams and other services. These are the challenge.
The first thing I did is understanding the pain point from Deployment team. What exact result we want? Since, it still have some possibilities that few restore requsts still block the deployment. But what is the percentage of total restore requests we want to put them away? I mean 1% total leaking requests is acceptable? Or 0.5% is acceptable? After that, have multiple meetings with Control plane team. To understand the code base on the current load balancer. How does it work today? How we evaluate the metrics and how we prioritize them. Then, finally give a design and ask all my teammates and above mentioned 2 team coworkers review my design. 
Durign this project, technical part, I learned how to use WCF, how to use StateMachine as a event tracker to track each request state. How modern api gateway, load balancer leverage loads among different nodes.
Leadership part, I learned how to drive my own project by collaborating with different teams. How to estimate the impact, etc.
 
如何处理同事Conflict
I still want to use the project I mentioned above, so during the design review. There are a lot of engineers and managers from other teams tried to "guard" their own code. But as the biggest stakeholder and main driver of this project. I should be bold, be open. So after the meeting, I set aside the conflicts and summary up the suggestions from other teams, like what impact on the other requests, how to evaluate the metrics calculation. I developed multiple prototypes and checked in them into stage clusters and evaluate them individually. Work with performance team, evaluate is there any increasing in request latency. Are workload among differnt nodes become uneven? Like node A cpu usage is 90, but B is only 12. Finally, collect all experiments' data and absorb other folks' suggestion to modify the initial design.
I learned how to drive a cross-team, cross-org project. How to understand other team's concern and convert their concerns to the roadmap of my project. I learned how to widen the impact of your project. Like during this project, Deployment team and I together implement a dashboard to monitor deployment status.  


有没有同事或老板给你Critical comments, 之后如何处理
I just have a critical comment recently, Phanindra. A knowledge for a new hire

别人东西Delay怎么办
Francesco, refactor connection interface. I mentor him. delay on his project. Understand his blockers cannot test (Env setup -- use local VM. the path point to physical machine path). manager push. Sync with manager. Share the burden from him.

Project一开始没方向该怎么办
Restore progress. Dont know where to start. Sync with my mentor. Do experiment to understand workflow. Understand how statemachine track the event. Use debugger to go through code line by line. 1:1 with mentor. To express my thought.
Learn: Get more clarity before start. should be bold. Dont be afraid to make change to do experiment.

有External Obstacle怎么处理

Any regression on your project.
new state in restore request state machine. To mitigate live site issue. But geo restore. No source server name. Why leak? Urgent!!! Must mitigate immediately
